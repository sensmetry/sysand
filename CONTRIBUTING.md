# Contributing to Sysand

Sysand is free and open source software, and as such welcomes contributions from
everyone. This text intends to document the practicalities of doing so.

## Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Sysand is distributed under free software licences (MIT and Apache-2.0).
As such, it must be ensured that the Sysand code-base only contains
source code that can be distributed under these licences. To ensure
this is the case, all commits intended for release must be [signed
(`-s`)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit.html#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s
), indicating that the contributor certifies they have the rights to contribute
the code as free software.

The text accepted by signing the commit, is the widely adopted DCO, maintained
by the Linux Foundation, the full text of which is reproduced below.
